The use of EDA, data wrangling techniques, and data cleaning methods 
are essential steps in any data analysis project. The methods discussed in this project 
help to identify patterns, relationships, and outliers in the data and ensure that the data 
is cleaned and transformed correctly for subsequent analysis. The analysis of the data 
provides valuable insights into the characteristics of the data, which can be used to 
inform decision-making processes. Overall, this project demonstrates the importance 
of understanding and preparing the data for analysis to derive meaningful insights and 
conclusions
